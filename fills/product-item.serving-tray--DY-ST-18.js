The Board are made of Acacia ,an attractive hardwood with walnut like coloration and durability. .<br/><br/>Every board is made from a unique piece of wood so this means the grain will be different on each and every one, they are all beautiful.<br/><br/>Using a pretty wooden board as a serving platter is an entertaining trick we love. This board is made just for that purpose. Use one side as a setting for cheese, charcuterie, and small bites and the other side as a cutting surface.<br/><br/><br/>Commercial Grade Metal Bearings - Heavy duty metal base and industrial grade bearings ensure a smooth, steady and whisper quiet action that will last for years vs low cost plastic bearings that are loud and jittery.<br/>"
